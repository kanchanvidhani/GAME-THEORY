Jack and Jelly are on the ship en route to discover Atlantis. The distance between their starting point and the city of Atlantis is N kilometers. They take turns manning the ship and each of them can steer the ship for 1, 2 or 4 kilometers in one turn. This should never exceed the remaining distance.
If Jelly starts as the captain-incharge of the ship, find who will be incharge of the ship when they reach Atlantis.


Example 1:

Input: N = 2
Output: JELLY
Explaination: Jelly can cover 2 Km 
in his first turn itself.

Example 2:

Input: N = 3
Output: JACK
Explaination: On his first turn Jelly can 
cover either 1 or 2km. In either case, Jack 
will cover the remaining distance in his turn.
 

Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function captain() which takes the N as input parameter and returns a string ("JACK" or "JELLY") denoting the name of the final captain.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 107

EXPLAINATION:-

 

Its just boils down to basic number system, Suppose, you and your friend are racing from some number till 0, and when you come to 0 you wanna know who won. Its simple according to rules find who will win if distance=10, because no matter what distance, every thing boils down under 10, and then you make a list that at N=1,2,3,…who won when and now whenever you get a distance N just see the chances of you winning in that list and if you can not divide wholly the distance you will lose GUARANTEED..

 

 

FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN JACK AND JELLY WILL RACE FOR

 

N=1,   JELLY WINS

N=2,   JELLY WINS

N=3,   JACK WINS

N=4,   JELLY WINS

N=5,   JELLY WINS

N=6,   JACK WINS

N=7,   JELLY WINS

N=8,   JELLY WINS

N=9,   JACK WINS

N=10, JELLY WINS

 

AS WE CAN SEE JACK CAN ONLY WIN 3 TIMES IN THIS, SO HIS CHANCES ARE ONLY 3 AMONG 10 SO NO MATTER WHAT DISTANCE IF YOU CAN'T GET MODULO N%3 EQUALS 0 HE WON'T WIN
